## üåê API Route

To keep the external API usage secure and organized, this project uses a Next.js API route as a proxy.

* **Endpoint:** `/api/recipes`
* **Functionality:** It receives a `searchTerm` from the client, forwards the request to TheMealDB API, and returns the response. This approach hides the external API endpoint from the client and allows for server-side logic or caching in the future.
